I stay in Gulu with my older sister who pays for my education at the Vocational Institute in Gulu town. Last year, when I made 20 years, I went with my friends to a Music show that was at the Stadium. There, we met some of the boys who are also at the Institute. We had fun. That night, I did not go home. I went with one of the boys who had paid for my drinks. He is tall and good looking, so we went to a lodge in town. I was not really drunk so when we were going, I stopped at one of the open shops and bought a condom which I insisted he uses. He had refused but finally I convinced him to use one. I went home the next day but we did not continue the affair.I think it was the alcohol. Anyway, a few weeks after, a team of doctors came to school for Counseling and HIV testing which we all did. The results shocked me, he was HIV positive and l was negative. Later, I leant from a friend that Michael was born HIV positive and he also agreed to it which made me very worried. After three months, l tested again and got the same result; HIV negative. The doctor told me that using a condom saved my life. Friends, I am so relieved. I was lucky that I remembered to get condoms. Life is precious let us guard it with condoms and always test before sex.                                                                      \t\t\t\r\n\r\n**The facts :**\r\n\r\nCondoms are sheaths or coverings that fit over man\u2019s erect penis, essential in preventing unwanted pregnancy and protecting against STDs, and HIV if correctly and consistently used. Most are made of latex rubber. Condoms work by forming a barrier that keeps sperm out of the vagina, preventing pregnancy. Also keep infections in semen or in penis or in the vagina from infecting the other partner. Check the expiry date on the package. Before sex, have it close by. Tear open the package carefully. Donot use fingernails, teeth, or anything that can damage the condom.As soon as your penis is hard, put the condom on. Squeeze the tip of the condom to keep air out. Unroll the condom down to the base of your penis. After sex, hold the rim of the condom. Take the penis out of the vagina before it gets soft, being careful not to spill the semen on your partner.Discard the used condom in a latrine or burn it and wash your hands.Condoms require correct use every time you have sex in order to be effectiveCondoms are available in shops, pharmacies, clinics, hospitals, health centers and form Community Reproductive health workers. \r\n\r\n**What to do:**\r\n\r\nFor more information about correct condom use, call Marie stopes on 0800120333 toll free or you visit your nearest health facility.",
