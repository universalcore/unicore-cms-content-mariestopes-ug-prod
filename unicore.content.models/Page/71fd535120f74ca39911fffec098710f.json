  "content": "I want to share my story how a condom helped me survive HIV. I stay in Gulu with my older sister who pays for my education at the Vocational Institute in Gulu town. Last year, when I made 20 years, I went with my friends to a music show that was at the Stadium. There, we met some of the boys who are also at the Institute. We had fun. That night, I did not go home. I went with one of the boys who had paid for my drinks. He is tall and good looking, so we went to a lodge in town. I was not really drunk so when we were going, I stopped at one of the open shops and bought a condom which I insisted he uses. He had refused but finally I convinced him to use one. I went home the next day but we did not continue the affair.I think it was the alcohol. Anyway, a few weeks after, a team of doctors came to school for Counseling and HIV testing which we all did. The results shocked me, he was HIV positive and l was negative. Later, I leant from a friend that Michael was born HIV positive and he also agreed to it which made me very worried. After three months, l tested again and got the same result; HIV negative. The doctor told me that using a condom saved my life. Friends, I am so relieved. I was lucky that I remembered to get condoms. Life is precious let us guard it with condoms and always test before sex.                                                                      \t\t\t\r\n\r\nLINK TO BE SAFE\r\n\r\nLINK TO TAKE ACTION",
