  "content": "I am Anita and I am 28 years. I live in Ruti, Mbarara district. I have a one year old baby girl and I wanted to wait for three years before I have another child. Some friends discouraged me from using Family Planning saying that it has negative side effects. I tried counting my days so that I know my safe days but my cycle is so irregular. I was always worried and buying pregnancy testing kits every month. This was not only expensive but I was also getting stressed and it was affecting my relationship with my husband. \r\n\r\nI listen to Radio West and one day, I heard a programme presented by Mariestopes on Family Planning. They read a number which I called and they gave me all the information on Family Planning and where to go for the service. My husband and I went to Mariestopes centre and chose to use Intra Uterine Devices (IUD). Despite the cramping and spotting in the first month, it\u2019s now seven months since I have been using IUD. I am absolutely relaxed and have no worries about unwanted pregnancies. I have found it convenient and friendly.\r\n",
