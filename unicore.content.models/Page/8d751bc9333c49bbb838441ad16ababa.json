  "content": "\r\nI am Natugonza and I am 28 years. I live in Ruti, Mbarara district. I have a one year old baby girl and I wanted to wait for three years before I have another child. Some friends discouraged me from using Family Planning saying that it has negative side effects. I tried countig my days so that I know my safe days but my cycle is so irregular. I was always worried and buying pregnancy testing kits every month. This was not only expensive but I was also getting stressed and it was affecting my relationship with my husband. I listen to Radio West and one day, I heard a programme presented by Mariestopes on Family Planning. They read a number which I called and they gave me all the information on Family Planning and where to go for the service. My husband and I went to Mariestopes centre and chose to use Intra Uterine Devices (IUD). Despite the cramping and spotting in the first month, it\u2019s now seven months since I have been using IUD. I am absolutely relaxed and have no worries about unwanted pregnancies. I have found it convenient and friendly.\t\t\t\r\n\r\n**The facts:**\r\n\r\nThe IUD is a small, plastic and copper device that is inserted into a woman\u2019s \r\nuterus to prevent pregnancy. Some call it the coil. It stops the sperm from joining the egg.It is safe, highly effective, and can last up to 12 years.It is easy to remove if the user wants to become pregnant. The woman does not need to come back for new supplies. It does not affect other medications and it has few side effects which are manageable.The coil has been tested and cannot rust inside, neither can it move anywhere else than through the cervix.\r\n\r\n\r\n**What to do :**\r\n\r\nFor more information on IUD use please call the toll free line 0800120333 or visit the nearest Mariestopes centre.",
