Some friends discouraged me from using Family Planning saying that it has negative side effects. I tried countig my days so that I know my safe days but my cycle is so irregular. I was always worried and buying pregnancy testing kits every month. This was not only expensive but I was also getting stressed and it was affecting my relationship with my husband. I listen to Radio West and one day, I heard a programme presented by Mariestopes on Family Planning. They read a number which I called and they gave me all the information on Family Planning and where to go for the service. My husband and I went to Mariestopes centre and chose to use Intra Uterine Devices (IUD). Despite the cramping and spotting in the first month, it\u2019s now seven months since I have been using IUD. I am absolutely relaxed and have no worries about unwanted pregnancies. I have found it convenient and friendly.\r\n\r\n[Be Safe][1]\r\n\r\n[Take Action!][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://iogt.qa-hub.unicore.io/page/585ab446df5b4c5981a9d09df5e1c13a/\r\n  [2]: http://iogt.qa-hub.unicore.io/page/c29fe0b3db2d4adea77bd84531d819ad/",
