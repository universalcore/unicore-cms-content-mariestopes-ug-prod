It stops the sperm from joining the egg.It is safe, highly effective, and can last up to 12 years.It is easy to remove if the user wants to become pregnant. The woman does not need to come back for new supplies. It does not affect other medications and it has few side effects which are manageable.The coil has been tested and cannot rust inside, neither can it move anywhere else than through the cervix.\r\n\r\n\r\n[My Choice][1]\r\n\r\n[Take Action!][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://iogt.qa-hub.unicore.io/page/8d751bc9333c49bbb838441ad16ababa/\r\n  [2]: http://iogt.qa-hub.unicore.io/page/9b9ef2d362864dd7b30cb1a9c6a4824d/",
